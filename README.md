# Median

Getting the median of an array.

# How to calculate the median

- Sort the list.
- Check if the length of the list is odd or even. If it's odd, we'll take the number from the middle of the array. But if the length is even, we have to take the two numbers that are in the middle, add them together and then divide them by 2.
